# Changelog

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-14

### Breaking changes
- `EEP` constructor redesigned: accepts `str | list[int]` instead of positional ints; `from_string()` classmethod removed; `__repr__` now returns `"A5-02-05"` (not `"EEP(A5-02-05)"`)
  - String form: `EEP("A5-02-05")`, `EEP("A5-08-01", Manufacturer.ELTAKO)`
  - List form for protocol-level use: `EEP([0xA5, 0x02, 0x05])`
- `start_learning()` parameter renamed: `timeout_seconds` → `timeout`; default changed from 60 to 30
- `start_learning()` now raises `RuntimeError` immediately if the gateway's base ID is not yet available (previously the error surfaced later at first teach-in)
- `Gateway.add_device()` now raises `ValueError` if the device address is already registered (previously silently overwrote)
- `Address` API simplified — removed `to_number()` (use `int(addr)`), `to_string()` (use `str(addr)`), `to_bytelist()` (use `.bytelist`), `to_json()`, `from_number()`, `from_string()` (pass value directly to constructor), `broadcast()`, and `validate_string()`
- `Gateway.entities()` renamed to `Gateway.device_descriptors` (now a `@property`)

### New features
- Full UTE teach-in: EEP validation, auto-registration, bidirectional response, sender pool allocation
- Full UTE teach-out: `TEACH_IN_DELETION` and toggle `TEACH_IN_OR_DELETION_OF_TEACH_IN` handling; requires `allow_teach_out=True` in `start_learning()`
- 4BS teach-in: learning mode guard + auto-registration (with profile); profileless telegrams are logged and ignored
- 4BS teach-in bidirectional response: gateway always echoes the EEP back with `SENDER_ID_STORED` / `EEP_SUPPORTED` result bits; `learn_status=RESPONSE` telegrams are discarded to avoid processing loopback responses
- 4BS re-teach-in: same-EEP re-teach-in is acknowledged and ignored; EEP-change re-teach-in updates the registered EEP and responds `ACCEPTED`
- 1BS teach-in: learning mode guard; `NewDeviceCallback` fires; no auto-registration (no EEP in telegram)
- `DeviceTaughtInCallback = Callable[[EURID, EEP], None]` — fires after successful teach-in and auto-registration
- `Gateway.add_device_taught_in_callback()` to register teach-in callbacks
- `EEPSpecification.uses_addressed_sending: bool` flag to distinguish destination-addressed (VLD) from sender-addressed (4BS actuator) devices; `A5-38-08` and `A5-20-01` set to `False`
- `start_learning()` log message now shows the effective sender address(es) — addressed devices (BaseID+0) and the next available sender-addressed slot
- `Address` constructor now accepts `bytes`, `bytearray`, or `list[int]` (4-element big-endian) in addition to `int` and `str`
- `Address.bytelist` property (replaces `to_bytelist()` method)
- `Entity` exported from the top-level `enocean_async` package

### Bug fixes
- `BaseAddress` upper bound corrected from `FF:FF:FF:80` to `FF:FF:FF:FE` (the broadcast address `FF:FF:FF:FF` is excluded; valid base address sender slots extend to `FF:FF:FF:FE`)

### Internal / maintenance
- Sender address pool: lowest free BaseID+1…+127 slot allocated at teach-in time for sender-addressed devices; derived on-demand from device registry
- UTE response encoding (`to_erp1()`) completed; `from_erp1()` length check corrected
- 4BS teach-in classes (`FourBSTeachInTelegram`, `FourBSLearnType`, `FourBSLearnStatus`, `FourBSTeachInResult`, `FourBSEEPResult`) moved to `protocol/erp1/fourbs.py`
- Docs moved to `docs/` folder; all README cross-links updated to absolute GitHub URLs
- `Entity` and `EntityType` moved to `semantics/entity.py` (merged from separate `entity_type.py`)
- `ObserverFactory` moved to `semantics/observer_factory.py`; `SemanticResolver` and `InstructionEncoder` type aliases moved to `semantics/types.py`; `DeviceDescriptor` moved to `semantics/device_descriptor.py`; all re-exported from `eep/profile.py` for backward compatibility


## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-08

### Breaking changes
- `Observation` fields renamed: `device_id` → `device`, `entity_id` → `entity`
- `Observation.time_elapsed` removed
- `EEPMessage.interpreted_values` renamed to `decoded`; `ValueWithUnit` renamed to `ValueWithContext` (with new optional `name` field)
- `Device.address` restricted to `EURID` only (was `EURID | BaseAddress`)
- `Gateway`'s device registry now only allows to register `EURID`s; also the new device callback only is emitted on `EURID`s
- `Device.telegrams_received` removed (was dead code)
- `NewDeviceCallback` now only fires for EURID senders; BaseAddress senders are silently tracked

### Internal / maintenance
- Single `__devices: dict[EURID, Device]` registry replaces the previous two-dict approach (`__known_device_eeps` + `__devices`)
- Docstrings added to `Observation` and `ObservationSource`
