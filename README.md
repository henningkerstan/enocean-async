# enocean-async
This is a light-weight, asynchronous, fully typed Python implementation of the [EnOcean Serial Protocol Version 3 (ESP3)](https://www.enocean.com/wp-content/uploads/Knowledge-Base/EnOceanSerialProtocol3-1.pdf) based on [pyserial-asyncio-fast](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial-asyncio-fast/). 

**It is currently still a proof of concept (PoC) implementation loosely based on my previous [Node.js implementation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enocean-core), so anything may change at anytime!**

What works:
- Receiving ESP3 packets and parsing them into ERP1 telegrams
- Sending ESP3 packets (only tested with Common Command telegrams so far) incl. waiting for response (or time-out) and reacting to the response
- Retrieving EURID, Base ID and version info from the EnOcean module
- Changing the Base ID
- Sending ERP1 telegrams
- Parsing EEPs (with F6-02-01 as tested/implemented example)
- Parse Universal Teach-In (UTE) Queries

What is missing/untested:
-  create and send Universal Teach-In (UTE) responses
